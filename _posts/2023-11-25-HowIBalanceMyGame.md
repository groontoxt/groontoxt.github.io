## balancing tricks

### Golden Triangle

these are three major stats in the game that determines balance.

- damage
  - berserker has high damage but low sustain.
- speed
  - ninja has high speed but average in everything else.
- toughness
  - tanks or any archetype that can take a lot of damage.

### Archtype

these are the archetypes having another arch type as its weakness. examples like a tank has high damage and has slow movement is weak against high speed and has high damage etc.

the best example I could give is Leage of Legend where its more complex to define a character than "speed", "damage" or "durability".

### Rock Paper Scissors

an archtype is weak against another archtype and an element is weak against another lement, etc.
this way it will be managable to balance your game.
