## balancing tricks

### Golden Triangle

these are three major stats in the game that determines balance.

- damage - ex. berserker has high damage but low sustain.
- speed - ex. ninja has high speed but average in everything else.
- toughness - ex. tanks or any archetype that can take a lot of damage.

### Archtype

these are the archetypes having another arch type as its weakness. examples like a tank has high damage and has slow movement is weak against high speed and has high damage etc.

the best example I could give is Leage of Legend where its more complex to define a character than "speed", "damage" or "durability".

### Rock Paper Scissors
