this game is a roguelite that has tranformation, evolution, and tradeoffs as the main mechanics

slows you but greatly increases AOE and damage

- **speed form**

weakens defences but greatly increases single target damage

- **caster form**

is average all around but has the best utility and AOE

- **slinger form**

throws projectiles that has damaging modifiers, great for single target

the game cutscene starts with a kid and his magical ferret being thrown into a monster infested pit

inspired by the furry companion, the kid mustered all her strength to summon a familliar and hope for the best
