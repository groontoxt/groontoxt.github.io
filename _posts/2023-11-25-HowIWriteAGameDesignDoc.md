## **concept**

### gameplay overview

the main focus of the game is switching between form and adapt **during** battle

**form system:**

- brute form
  - accesible if you have **strength** as the dominant stat
  - slows you but greatly increases AOE and damage

- speed form
  - accesible if you have **speed** as the dominant stat
  - weakens defences but greatly increases single target damage

- caster form
  - accesible if you have **void** as the dominant stat
  - is average all around but has the best utility and AOE

- slinger form
  - accesible if you have **dexterity** as the dominant stat
  - throws projectiles that has damaging modifiers, great for single target

### theme interpretation

pick your strength and weakness

forms give you abilities that makes you strong for certain situations
and tradeoff stats and makes you weaker for other situations
