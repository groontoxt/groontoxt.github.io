## Concept

### Gameplay Overview

The main focus of the game is switching between forms and adapting **during** battle.

**Form System:**

- **Brute Form**
  - Accessible if you have **strength** as the dominant stat.
  - Slows you but greatly increases AOE and damage.

- **Speed Form**
  - Accessible if you have **speed** as the dominant stat.
  - Weakens defenses but greatly increases single-target damage.

- **Caster Form**
  - Accessible if you have **void** as the dominant stat.
  - Is average all around but has the best utility and AOE.

- **Slinger Form**
  - Accessible if you have **dexterity** as the dominant stat.
  - Throws projectiles with damaging modifiers, great for single target.

### Gameplay Theme Interpretation

Pick your strength and weakness. Forms give you abilities that make you strong for certain situations and tradeoff stats, making you weaker for other situations.
