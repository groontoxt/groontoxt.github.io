## Combat System

Attacking:

- Fast or slow
  - Anticipation
  - Strike
  - Contact
  - Recovery

Attack range

Tactical options:

- Inputs
- Certain attacks have advantages

Block and dodge:

- Parry - nullifies damage before it contacts
- Counter - a block that deals damage

Stun lock:

- Dealing damage stuns the enemy (a form of positive feedback)
- Receiving damage stuns you (a form of negative feedback)

Enemy design:

- Certain enemies are more receptive to a certain type of damage or stronger against a certain damage type

Encourage full move set:

- A full combo might give rewards like heal or stun lock, etc. (a form of positive feedback)

Making an impact:

- Make attacks have levels of satisfaction
- The stronger the attack, the more flashy the spectacle should be
