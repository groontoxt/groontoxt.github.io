## game summary pitch

the game cutscene starts with a kid and his magical ferret being thrown into a monster infested pit
faced with spawns of monsters, the ferret activates his powerful forceshield to protect his master
inspired by the furry companion, the kid mustered all her strength to summon a familliar and hope for the best
as she opened her eyes, a weird creature that just ate a monster transform before her eyes and ripped the foe to shreds
her eyes lit for they might have a chance to survive.
