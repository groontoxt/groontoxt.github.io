## **introduction**

### game summary pitch

this game is a roguelite that has tranformation, evolution, and tradeoffs as the main mechanics

**brute form** slows you but greatly increases AOE and damage
**speed form** weakens your defences but greatly increases your single target damage
**caster form** is average all around but has the best utility and AOE.

the game cutscene starts with a kid and his magical ferret being thrown into a monster infested pit
faced with spawns of monsters, the ferret activates his powerful forceshield to protect his master
inspired by the furry companion, the kid mustered all her strength to summon a familliar and hope for the best

### inspiration

- neon genesis' eva unit 0 - for the look and feel
- pacific rim - for the monster design
- dota 2's morphling - the stat affects the form
- one piece - tony tony chopper's transformation
- genshin impact - the element switch
- starcraft - zerg evolution tree
- kingdom rush - tower defence style and tower evolution tree
- lilo and stitch - stitch's siblings appearance reflect their special ability
