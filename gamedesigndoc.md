## **introduction**

### game summary pitch

this game is a roguelite that has tranformation, evolution, and tradeoffs as the main mechanics
it also sports a puzzle subgameplay that uses the transformation as a tool to solve them

the game cutscene starts with a kid and his magical ferret being thrown into a monster infested pit
faced with spawns of monsters, the ferret activates his powerful forceshield to protect his master
inspired by the furry companion, the kid mustered all her strength to summon a familliar and hope for the best

### inspiration

- **neon genesis' eva unit 0, starcraft's zerg**
  - neon genesis is a great example of making something humanoid yet look out of this world
  - zerg on the otherhand is great at making something organic

- **dota 2's morphling, one piece's tony tony choppe**
  - morphling's theme of being addaptive is both a blessing and a curse and i want to capture that juggling act
  - tony tony chopper's forms engenious way to vissually explains their ability without a long winded explanation

- **lilo and stitch**
  - stitch's siblings appearance reflect their special ability

- **jujutsu kaisen's general mahoraga**
  - make the player feel like they are in controll of the fight by addapting

- **genshin impact**
  - the element switch battle mechanic would work great for the swtiching between forms

- **caster form** is average all around but has the best utility and AOE
- **slinger form** throws projectiles with damaging modifiers, great for single target
